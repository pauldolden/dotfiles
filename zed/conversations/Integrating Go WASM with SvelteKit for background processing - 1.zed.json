You need to compile your Go code into a WebAssembly module, serve this module as part of your SvelteKit application, and then use JavaScript to load and interact with the WASM module. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Go Code\n\n1. **Create Your Go Program**: Write the Go program you need to compile to WASM. For example, save the following as `main.go`:\n\n   ```go\n   package main\n\n   import (\n       \"syscall/js\"\n   )\n\n   func add(this js.Value, inputs []js.Value) interface{} {\n       sum := inputs[0].Int() + inputs[1].Int()\n       return js.ValueOf(sum)\n   }\n\n   func registerCallbacks() {\n       js.Global().Set(\"add\", js.FuncOf(add))\n   }\n\n   func main() {\n       c := make(chan struct{}, 0)\n       println(\"WASM Go Initialized\")\n       registerCallbacks()\n       <-c\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Compile to WebAssembly**: Use the Go compiler to compile your code to a `.wasm` file. You may need to set environment variables for the target architecture.\n\n   ```bash\n   GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o main.wasm main.go\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Serve the WASM File with Your SvelteKit Application\n\n1. **Add the WASM File to Your Public Folder**: Move your `main.wasm` file into the `static` folder of your SvelteKit project. If your project does not have a `static` directory, create one at the root level. Files in the `static` directory are served at the root path.\n\n2. **Include WASM Executing JavaScript**: Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `initWasm.js`) to load and run your WASM module. Also, place this file inside the `static` folder. Hereâ€™s how the file could look:\n\n   ```javascript\n   async function init() {\n       const go = new Go(); // Go is a global object provided by wasm_exec.js. See next step.\n       const wasmModuleUrl = 'main.wasm';\n       const wasmResponse = await fetch(wasmModuleUrl);\n       const wasmBinary = await wasmResponse.arrayBuffer();\n       const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiate(wasmBinary, go.importObject);\n       go.run(instance);\n       return instance; // makes the wasm functions available after load\n   }\n\n   window.initWASM = init; // Makes `init` globally accessible\n   ```\n\n3. **wasm_exec.js**: Get `wasm_exec.js` from your Go installation (It's usually located in `/usr/local/go/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js` for Unix systems or similar path) and place it in your `static` folder. This script provides necessary glue code for running Go-WASM.\n\n### Step 3: Load and Use the WASM Module in Your Svelte Component\n\n1. **Create a Svelte Component**: Now you'll modify a Svelte component to use the WASM module. For example:\n\n   ```svelte\n   <script>\n     import { onMount } from 'svelte';\n\n     onMount(async () => {\n       await initWASM();\n       const result = window.add(2, 3); // Call the `add` function provided by Go\n       console.log(result); // Should log `5`\n     });\n   </script>\n   ```\n\n2. **Load `wasm_exec.js` and `initWasm.js`**: Ensure these scripts are loaded before you attempt to use the WASM module. An easy way to do this is by including them in your `src/app.html` (template file), or dynamically load them in the Svelte component before initializing the WASM module.\n\nExample `src/app.html`:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>...</head>\n<body>\n  <script defer src=\"/wasm_exec.js\"></script>\n  <script defer src=\"/initWasm.js\"></script>\n  <script type=\"module\">\n    // Import your Svelte app entry point here if needed\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nOr dynamically load them in your Svelte component before calling `initWASM`.\n\n### Notes and Tips\n\n- Different browsers have different security restrictions on loading WASM files, testing on a local development server and on your production environment is recommended.\n- Pay attention to CORS policies when fetching the `.wasm` file, especially if it's being served from a different origin in production.\n- The integration demonstrated here is quite straightforward. Depending on your SvelteKit version and setup, adjustments might be necessary, especially considering how SvelteKit evolves.\n\nThis guide should give you a good foundation to embed and call a Go WASM module from your SvelteKit application!\ncan't I use wasip1 instead of js?\nAs of my last knowledge update in April 2023, using WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) with SvelteKit, or specifically with web applications, requires a bit of context clarification. WASI provides a standard set of system interfaces for WebAssembly modules, aimed primarily at supporting non-web embeddings and allowing WASM modules to interact with system resources like files and environment variables in a secure way. This is especially useful for server-side or command-line applications that compile to WebAssembly and need to interact with the host system.\n\n### Running WASI in Web Context\n\nIf your goal is to integrate a Go WebAssembly binary that uses WASI (for example, for filesystem access or other system-level features) into a SvelteKit (or any web-based) application, there are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Direct Support**: Traditional browsers don't natively support WASI because it's designed to provide a POSIX-like interface to WebAssembly, which includes capabilities that browsers typically restrict for security reasons. So, running a WASI module directly in a browser environment, as you would with a standard WebAssembly module targeting the web, isn't straightforward.\n\n2. **Workarounds and Tools**: There are tools and workarounds that simulate a WASI environment within the web browser. For instance, using a library like `@wasmer/wasi` in the JavaScript glue code can provide shims for WASI syscalls, making it possible to run WASI-based WebAssembly in a web context. Keep in mind these are workarounds and might not fully support all WASI functionality or perform with the same efficiency as native implementations.\n\n### Example Using @wasmer/wasi with SvelteKit\n\nIf you still wish to pursue integrating a WASI WebAssembly module within a SvelteKit application, you could:\n\n1. **Compile Your Go Code with WASI Target**: Make sure your Go project is compiled targeting WASI. This might require specific build flags or environment settings suitable for compiling Go to WASI-compatible WebAssembly.\n\n2. **Use a WASI Shim in Your SvelteKit Application**: Libraries like `@wasmer/wasi`, and `@wasmer/wasmfs` can be utilized in your application to provide the necessary WASI environment within the browser. \n\nHere's an extremely simplified example demonstrating the concept:\n\n```javascript\n// This assumes you have installed @wasmer/wasi and related libraries\nimport { WASI } from \"@wasmer/wasi\";\nimport { WasmFs } from \"@wasmer/wasmfs\";\n\nasync function initWASI() {\n  // Setup the WASI instance\n  const wasmFs = new WasmFs();\n  \n  let wasi = new WASI({\n    // Configure environment, arguments, and preopen directories here.\n    // These will vary based on the needs of your WASM module.\n  });\n\n  // Fetch your WASM module\n  const wasmBinary = await fetch(\"your_wasi_module.wasm\").then(response => response.arrayBuffer());\n  const wasmModule = await WebAssembly.compile(wasmBinary);\n\n  // Instantiate module with WASI imports\n  const instance = await WebAssembly.instantiate(wasmModule, {\n    ...wasi.getImports(wasmModule)\n  });\n\n  wasi.start(instance); // Start your WASI instance\n}\n\n// Call this function from your Svelte component's onMount, for example.\n```\n\n### Keep in Mind:\n\n- Running WASI in the browser does not magically grant your WebAssembly module access to the host's actual filesystem or unrestricted system resources. WASI in the web context works by providing a virtualized environment.\n- This solution is a bit of a workaround and may come with limitations depending on the specific system calls your application needs.\n- Performance and compatibility should be thoroughly tested, as running WASI modules in the web is not their primary intended use case.\n\nGiven the evolving landscape of WebAssembly, newer and more integrated solutions may emerge.
